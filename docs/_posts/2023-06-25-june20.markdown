# **6/20 Development Update**

- Installed everything required to get jekyll running on my system

  - Experienced multiple errors that ended up being a result of lack of permissions  
    which were resolved by using the commands to a specific path.

- Used jekyll to created a static website
- Deployed the static website using github pages under notjamesb.github.io
- Learned more about Markdown and it's syntax

  - Plans to make the website more "Me".

- Created a new larvel project with plans to make a new API App
