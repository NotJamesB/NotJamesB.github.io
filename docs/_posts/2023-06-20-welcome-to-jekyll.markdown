# **6/20 Development Update**

- Installed everything required to get jekyll running on my system

  - Experienced multiple errors that ended up being a result of lack of permissions  
    which were resolved by using the commands to a specific path.

- Used jekyll to created a static website
- Deployed the static website using github pages under notjamesb.github.io
- Learned more about Markdown and it's syntax

  - Plans to make the website more "Me".

- Created a new larvel project with plans to make a new API App

# **6/21 Development Update**

- Keywords go in config folder
  - My task is to create an api that calls the DIR api that will return active codes for that market. And then call the keyword with semrush for the US/region.
- Development today was slower because of work obligations  
  i plan to dig deeper into it tomorrow!

# **6/22 Development Update**

- Looked into SEMrush and their api documentation
  - A pro/business plan is needed to access their api, so i will just manuall add the weight of the search results for now
- Added the "keyword array" to my config file
- Constructed a controller to grab the keyword with the weight of the keyword based on how often it's searched (With manual weight placeholders for now)
- Initial commit to new repository

# **6/23 Development Update**

- Manually added weights to the search results based off actual traffic
- Slower development day due to double work shift


# **6/24 Development Update**
