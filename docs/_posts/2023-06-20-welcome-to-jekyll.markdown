# **6/20 Development Update**

- Installed everything required to get jekyll running on my system

  - Experienced multiple errors that ended up being a result of lack of permissions  
    which were resolved by using the commands to a specific path.

- Used jekyll to created a static website
- Deployed the static website using github pages under notjamesb.github.io
- Learned more about Markdown and it's syntax

  - Plans to make the website more "Me".

- Created a new larvel project with plans to make a new API App


# **6/21 Development Update**  

- Keywords go in config folder  
  - My task is to create an api that calls the DIR api that will return active codes for that market. And then call the keyword with semrush for the US/region.
- Development today was slower because of work obligations  
i plan to dig deeper into it tomorrow!
