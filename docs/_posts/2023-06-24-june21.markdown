# **6/21 Development Update**

- Keywords go in config folder
  - My task is to create an api that calls the DIR api that will return active codes for that market. And then call the keyword with semrush for the US/region.
- Development today was slower because of work obligations  
  i plan to dig deeper into it tomorrow!
