# **6/26 Development Update**  

## What i did
- Reasearched more about API's and how to use them more efficiently
    - My plan in doing this is trying to go back to the basics of API's and understand how i can do things more efficently so i can inevitably produce better code

## What i need to do

- Continue work on the API Appraiser for DMScore
- Add more data for the api class to handler
