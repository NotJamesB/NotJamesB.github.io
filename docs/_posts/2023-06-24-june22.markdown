# **6/22 Development Update**

- Looked into SEMrush and their api documentation
  - A pro/business plan is needed to access their api, so i will just manuall add the weight of the search results for now
- Added the "keyword array" to my config file
- Constructed a controller to grab the keyword with the weight of the keyword based on how often it's searched (With manual weight placeholders for now)
- Initial commit to new repository
