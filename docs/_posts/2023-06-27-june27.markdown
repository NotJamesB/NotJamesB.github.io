# **6/28 Development Update**

## What i did

- Added a post funtion to the app
  - I added a post function so we can efficiently store data into the array of data without the need of digging into the main files to do so
  - Only issue with this is that i now need somewhere to STORE the array so that i can update the existing stored data and retrieve it. That's where MySql Comes in.

## What i need to do

- Create a table and database to effectively store the array of data
- Successfully store the data inside the DB so that we can consistently update the API with new information and keywords.
